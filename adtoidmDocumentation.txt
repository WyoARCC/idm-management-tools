ADtoIDM.py Documentation
This script syncs group(s) in the University's AD server
with ARCC's IDM server. It doesn't create users. It simply adds
or removes users until the given group(s) match on both the UW AD server
and ARCC's IDM server.

Necessary Files

uwyoldap.py

Python Modules Needed

getpass
subprocess
argparse
ldap

Permissions
For the script to work, you'll need to have a Keberos key
for a user with valid permissions to make changes
to IDM in your keyring. The username and password prompt is to read
the University's AD server.

Usage
The script takes arguments from the command line.
Use --help for help

positional arguments:
  cns                   The script will attempt to add the given CNs.

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
    The username to be used to access the AD server. The
    domain uwyo is assumed, so you don't have to specify it.


CNs are just the group name. For example: UWIT-PL-ARCC-Interns
Multiple groups can be synced at once. Just provide multiple
CNs.
If a username isn't given, the user will be prompted for it.
You will always be prompted for a password. It doesn't echo.
