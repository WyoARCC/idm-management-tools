ADtoIDM Documentation
=====================
adtoidm.py: This script syncs group(s) from the University's AD server to ARCC's
IDM server. It doesn't create users. It simply adds or removes users from/to IDM
groups until they match the group membership on the UW AD server.

Necessary Files:
----------------
	adtoidm.py
	uwyoldap.py
	idm_manage.py

All of the above files can be found under the WyoARCC/idm-management-tools 
repo.

Python Modules Needed:
----------------------
	sys
	getpass
	subprocess
	argparse
	ldap

All of these come with Python except for ldap. It can be installed by:
	sudo pip install ldap

Permissions:
------------
1) For the script to work, you'll need to have a Keberos key for a user with 
   permissions to make changes to IDM (the user 'admin' works) in your keyring. 
2) The prompt for username and password while the script is running is for an
   AD user (logging in as self should work).

Usage:
------
adtoidm.py [-h] [-u USERNAME] [cn [cn ...]]

The script uses from following command line arguments:
  required arguments:
    cn...                 the group names (CNs) that the script will sync
  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
    The username to be used to access the AD server. The
    domain uwyo is assumed, so you don't have to specify it.

* CNs are group names (e.g. UWIT-PL-ARCC-Interns). Multiple groups can be 
  synced at once - just provide multiple CNs.
* If a username isn't given, the user will be prompted for it.
* The user will always be prompted for a password - it doesn't echo.
