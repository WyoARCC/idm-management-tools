uwyoldap Documentation
======================
uwyoldap is a python module to make it easier to work with UW's LDAP server.

The main class is UWyoLDAP. Using it creates a connection to the server, and 
the object can be used to perform searches. To connect, all that is needed is 
a username (with domain) and a password. I recommend getting the password using
the python module getpass. A function called unbind is provided to disconnect
from the server.

search function
---------------
search is the main search function. It uses searchByCN, searchByGID, and 
emptySearch to actually perform its searches. Search takes in the "search 
term", this can either be empty, CNs, or GIDs. It also needs the type for the 
object being searched for, and finally, it needs an argument to say whether CNs
or GIDs are what the "search term" is. The type for the object and the search 
term should be provided as constants. 

Constants: - For the object type they are: GROUP, USER 
           - For the "search term" type they are: CN, EMPTY, GIDNUMBER

Return type: search returns a list of objects, either a list of LDAPUser objects
             or a list of LDAPGroup objects. Both the LDAPUser and LDAPGroup 
             classes inherit from the LDAPObj class. 

LDAPObj class
-------------
Class LDAPObj has the attributes:
- dn:          the distinguished name of the object
- cn:          the common name of the object
- memberOf:    a list of CNs for groups that the object is a member of
- info:        a list of the info returned from the search
- description: the description of the object, if it exists

LDAPUser class
--------------
LDAPUser has all of the attributes from the LDAPObj class, plus the following:
- departments:    a list of departments that the user is a member of
- isFaculty:      a boolean that is true if the user is faculty
- isEmployee:     a boolean that is true if the user is an employee
- isStudent:      a boolean that is true if the user is a student
- isARCCEmployee: a boolean that is true if the user is an ARCC employee
- isRetired:      a boolean that is true if the user is retired

LDAPUser has the method getCollege()
It takes no arguments, and returns a list of colleges that the user belongs to.
It doesn't work on undergraduate students.

LDAPGroup class
---------------
LDAPGroup has all of the attributes from the LDAPObj class, plus the following:
- member: a dictionary of members of the group. The key is the CN of the member,
          the value is the DN of that member.

LDAPComputer class
------------------
Finally, there is an LDAPComputer class, but it isn't finished or supported by 
the rest of the code.

Examples
--------
Examples of using this class can be found in the following scripts:
* Under the arcc_metrics repo:
  - num_of_faculty.py
  - num_of_students.py
  - user_colleges.py
  - usernetplot/usernetplot.py
* Under the idm-management-tools repo:
  - adtoidm.py
